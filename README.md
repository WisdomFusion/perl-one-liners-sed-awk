# Perl One-Liners, sed & awk

一行命令搞惦一件事情，这个很酷。不过，有时候这不是一件简单的事情，有时候这又是 ugly 或是可读性很差的解决方案。不管怎么说，shell 脚本或命令行中能快速写出 One-Liner 语句，这是一种 ability。

本文主要用于日常参考和记录用，不是为了展示单行命令的“长处”（往往单行，也意味着它很长的）。:smile:

It's cool to achieve a goal using one-liner. However, sometimes it's not a simple task, and sometimes a bit ugly or a solution of bad readability. Anyhow, it's an ability that we able to write one-liner statement in a shell script or command line task.

This article is written for reference and noting, not to represent how long one-liner can be, although it is always seems too long. :smile:
